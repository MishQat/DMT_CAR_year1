# DMT Car project (first year, first sem course group project)
**Author:** Ahmed Mishqat â€” BEng Mechanical Engineering, University of Manchester 

**Summary:** CAD design, prototyping and assembly of a Car that used weight and gravity to be propelled.

# About the project: A mechanical engineering design challenge where a car was built using wood and metal parts supplied. The propulsion system relied on a suspended weight wrapped around a gearbox shaft; as the weight descended under gravity, it rotated the shaft and drove the wheels. The vehicle was tested on an inclined track, requiring careful consideration of gearing, stability, and energy transfer. The project emphasised hands-on prototyping, mechanical design, and practical application of engineering principles.

# The whole project was done in a group of 6 people. I was solely in charge of making all the CAD models and the assembly in SolidWorks. Furthermore, I wrote a Python code to find the estimated time to finish the track
